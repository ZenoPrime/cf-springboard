    expect(screen.getByText('Test Title')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('handles optional props correctly', () => {
    const mockAction = jest.fn();
    render(
      <Component 
        title="Test" 
        description="Test description" 
        onAction={mockAction} 
      />
    );
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test description')).toBeInTheDocument();
    
    const button = screen.getByRole('button');
