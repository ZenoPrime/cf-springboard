# **PRD: AI-Powered Public Services & Utilities Aggregator**

## **Overview**

Build a centralized platform where users can find and access information about local public servicesâ€”such as electricity, water services, emergency contacts, public transport, and municipal services.

## **Problem Statement**

Sierra Leone lacks digital directories for critical public services. Citizens rely on word-of-mouth or have to visit offices to get simple information or updates.

* Provide real-time updates (e.g., power outages, water availability).

* Help citizens find nearest facilities and contact info.

## **Features**

### **User Features**

* Searchable listing by category (e.g., police, electricity, transport) and location.

* AI assistant to answer common service-related questions.

* Alerts system for public announcements.

### **Admin Features**

* CMS to manage and update listings.

* Push notifications for outages or emergencies.

### **AI Features**

* OCR to extract contact info from flyers/documents uploaded.

## **Non-Goals**

* Payment integration.

* Service issue resolution (e.g., bill payments).

## **User Stories**

1. As a user, I want to search for the nearest electricity office.

2. As a system, I want to notify users about sudden water outage and deadlines..

3. As a content admin, I want to add or update service info.
