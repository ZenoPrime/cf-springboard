# **Agricultural Supply Chain Tracking System**

*A blockchain-based platform for Sierra Leone's agricultural sector*

## **Introduction**

### **Purpose**

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the detailed specifications for developing the Agricultural Supply Chain Tracking System for Sierra Leone. It serves as the primary reference for all stakeholders, including developers, product managers, farmers, buyers, government officials, and NGO partners.

### **Project Overview**

The Agricultural Supply Chain Tracking System is a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize how agricultural products move from farm to market in Sierra Leone. By leveraging blockchain technology, QR codes, and mobile money integration, the system aims to introduce transparency, efficiency, and trust into agricultural supply chains while providing instant payments to farmers.

### **Problem Statement**

Sierra Leone's agricultural sector faces several critical challenges:

1. **Payment Delays**: Smallholder farmers often wait weeks or months to receive payment for their produce, creating cash flow problems and limiting their ability to reinvest in their farms.

2. **Limited Transparency**: Lack of verifiable tracking systems makes it difficult to trace products through the supply chain, impacting food safety and limiting access to premium markets.

3. **Information Asymmetry**: Farmers have limited access to market price information, often resulting in undervaluation of their products.

4. **Limited Access to Finance**: Without formal documentation of transactions and production history, farmers struggle to access loans and financial services.

5. **Inefficient Supply Chains**: Manual, paper-based processes create inefficiencies, increase costs, and limit growth potential.

### **Scope**

The Agricultural Supply Chain Tracking System will encompass:

* QR code-based product tracking from farm to consumer  
* Smart contract-enabled instant payment processing  
* Mobile money wallet integration for cashless transactions  
* Real-time price discovery and market intelligence  
* Digital documentation of agricultural transactions and product history  
* User-friendly mobile applications for all stakeholders

The system will initially focus on high-value export crops (cocoa, coffee, cashew) and essential food crops (rice, cassava) in Sierra Leone, with potential for expansion to other products and neighboring countries in future phases.

## **Objectives**

### **Business Goals**

1. Create a transparent, efficient, and trustworthy agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone  
2. Reduce payment delays for farmers from weeks/months to under 24 hours  
3. Improve food safety and traceability for domestic and export markets  
4. Increase farmers' access to fair market prices and financial services  
5. Generate valuable data insights for agricultural policy and planning  
6. Create a sustainable business model that benefits all stakeholders
