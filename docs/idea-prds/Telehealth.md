**Telehealth Platform**

**üéØ Executive Summary** 

The Telehealth Platform for Rural Women is an innovative digital health solution designed to offer virtual consultations, health education, and access to medical resources to underserved rural women. The platform addresses critical barriers to healthcare access such as geographic isolation, limited transportation, and the lack of available healthcare professionals in rural regions. By facilitating online consultations with doctors and providing health education through various mediums, the platform aims to improve maternal and reproductive health, empower women with health knowledge, and reduce the need for travel, making healthcare more accessible and affordable. **The platform specifically accommodates low bandwidth environments and supports both literate and illiterate users through voice-based interfaces, ensuring accessibility even for those without smartphones.**

**‚Åâ Problem Statement & User Stories** 

Rural women in Sierra Leone and other sub-Saharan African regions face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, including long travel distances, limited healthcare infrastructure, and low access to trained healthcare professionals. These barriers result in poor health outcomes, particularly in maternal and reproductive health. The current healthcare delivery system does not meet the needs of these rural women, as it is either too costly or inaccessible. **Additionally, low literacy rates and limited access to smartphones further restrict access to digital health solutions.**

User Stories: As a rural woman, I want to access healthcare consultations remotely so that I don't have to travel long distances.

As a rural woman, I want to receive health education materials via my mobile phone so that I can make informed decisions about my health.

As an illiterate user, I want to interact with the platform using voice commands so I can access healthcare services without needing to read.

As a basic phone user, I want to access consultations through voice calls or USSD so I can use the service without a smartphone.

As a healthcare provider, I want to offer consultations and educational content to rural women to improve their health outcomes.

As a mobile payment user, I want to be able to pay for consultations using mobile money to avoid the need for traditional banking services.

**As a user in a low-bandwidth area, I want the application to function with minimal data usage so I can access healthcare services reliably.**

**üß© Goals and Non-Goals Goals**

Provide a platform for virtual consultations between healthcare providers and rural women.

Deliver health education on maternal and reproductive health, hygiene, and general wellness.

Integrate mobile payment systems for affordable access to healthcare services.

Offer offline access to health content to accommodate areas with limited internet connectivity.

**Enable voice-based interaction for illiterate users to navigate the platform without reading text.**

**Support basic feature phones through IVR (Interactive Voice Response) and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) interfaces.**

**Optimize for low-bandwidth environments with data-light content delivery.**

Ensure that the platform is scalable, supporting future expansion to other regions and countries.

**Non-Goals**

The platform will not provide physical healthcare services; it focuses solely on virtual consultations and education.

The platform will not develop its own healthcare services but will facilitate access to third-party healthcare providers.

The platform will not focus on areas outside of women's health in the initial phase.

**The platform will not require high-speed internet or advanced smartphones for core functionality.**

‚è≥ Key Metrics To measure the success of the Telehealth Platform, the following key metrics will be tracked:

User Engagement Metrics: Number of registered users (rural women). Frequency of consultations booked and attended. User satisfaction scores based on feedback. **Percentage of users engaging through voice interfaces vs. text-based interfaces.** **Number of users accessing via basic phones vs. smartphones.**

Health Outcomes Metrics: Number of women accessing maternal and reproductive health consultations. Improvement in health outcomes (tracked through follow-ups and feedback).

Revenue Metrics: Total amount of payments processed via mobile money. Number of paid consultations vs. free consultations.

Platform Usage Metrics: Average time spent on health education content. Offline content usage and engagement. **Average data consumption per session (to monitor low-bandwidth effectiveness).** **Voice interaction success rate (percentage of successfully completed voice commands).**
