# **SkillProof Platform \- Product Requirements Document**

## **üéØ Executive Summary**

SkillProof is a decentralized freelance platform built on Solana's blockchain that revolutionizes how clients and freelancers connect and collaborate. By leveraging compressed NFTs, token extensions, and on-chain attestations, SkillProof creates a transparent, equitable, and efficient ecosystem that addresses the fundamental challenges of traditional freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.

Traditional freelance platforms are plagued by high fees, inconsistent quality, opaque governance, unfair dispute resolution, and barriers for new freelancers. SkillProof solves these issues through a decentralized approach where work history is verified through tamper-proof "Proof NFTs," smart contracts automate fair payments, and a DAO ensures transparent governance.

By providing a structured blockchain-based platform for freelance engagement, SkillProof enables clients to hire with confidence, freelancers to build verifiable reputations, and both parties to enjoy lower fees and fair governance in a trust-minimized environment.

## **‚Åâ Problem Statement & User Stories**

Freelancers and clients need a transparent, fair, and efficient platform where they can connect, collaborate, and transact without the high fees, hidden costs, unreliable vetting, and opaque policies of traditional platforms. The proposed solution is SkillProof, a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide verifiable work history, fair dispute resolution, and automated payments.
