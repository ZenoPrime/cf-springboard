# **WebSnap \- Product Requirements Document**

## **üéØ Executive Summary**

WebSnap is an automated web archiving tool designed to convert large lists of URLs into organized, searchable, timestamped PDFs. The platform addresses critical challenges faced by professionals who need to preserve and analyze web content at scale, including legal professionals, researchers, marketers, and archivists.

Current methods of web archiving, such as manual "Ctrl+P" to PDF, are time-consuming and impractical for large-scale needs. WebSnap solves this by automating the process, allowing users to upload Excel files containing thousands of URLs and generating properly formatted, searchable PDFs with metadata. These PDFs are automatically organized into subfolders and can be integrated with cloud storage solutions.

For example, a law firm archiving 4,000 web pages for 80 litigation cases can save approximately 115 hours per month while ensuring court-admissible evidence. By providing a streamlined, efficient solution to web archiving challenges, WebSnap aims to become the go-to platform for professionals needing reliable, scalable web content preservation.

## **‚Åâ Problem Statement & User Stories**

Professionals across various fields need an efficient way to archive web content at scale, maintain its integrity, and organize it for future reference. The manual methods currently employed are time-consuming, error-prone, and often fail to properly authenticate the archived content. WebSnap addresses these challenges by providing an automated solution that handles the entire process from URL collection to organized, searchable PDFs.
