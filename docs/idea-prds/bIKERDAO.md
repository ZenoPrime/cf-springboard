#  **BikerDAO PRD** 

## **1\. Product Brief**

### **Overview**

BikerDAO is a decentralized platform designed to help commercial bikers in Sierra Leone track, pay, and claim daily ticket deposits. It aims to enhance financial security, facilitate automatic claims for incidents, and serve as a governance tool to represent biker sentiment.

### **Importance**

Motorbike taxis play a crucial role in Sierra Leone’s transport ecosystem. However, they face financial insecurity, unpredictable penalties, and lack of structured governance. BikerDAO addresses these challenges by providing transparency, automation, and collective representation.

### **Vision**

To empower commercial bikers with a secure and automated system for financial transactions, claims, and governance, ensuring their contributions to urban mobility are recognized and protected.

### **Platform Type**

* Mobile-first (USSD and app-based for accessibility)  
* Blockchain-enabled for transparency and security

  ### **Key Features**

1. **Daily Ticket Deposits** – Bikers can pay daily parking and road usage fees via mobile money or crypto.  
2. **Automated Claims** – Instant claim submissions for accidents, police fines, and court fees.  
3. **Biker Insurance Fund** – Pool contributions to support emergency claims and reduce financial strain.  
4. **Governance & Sentiment Analysis** – Collect bikers’ opinions and relay concerns to authorities and policymakers.  
5. **DAO-Based Voting** – Bikers can participate in key decisions affecting their industry.  
6. **Yield on Balance** – Bikers earn interest on their deposited funds through low-risk investment mechanisms, such as treasury-backed stablecoins or micro-lending pools.

## **2\. Background & Context**

### **Problem**

* Bikers struggle with managing daily payments, which are often mismanaged or extorted.  
* Claims for incidents (accidents, fines) are cumbersome and lack transparency.  
* Bikers have no formal representation in governance despite being a major transport workforce.

### **Pain Points**

* Lack of financial safety net  
* Difficulty in tracking daily payments  
* No structured claim process  
* Absence of biker governance representation

### **Hypothesis**

If commercial bikers have a transparent, automated payment and claim system backed by blockchain and DAO governance, they will experience financial security, faster resolutions for claims, and stronger collective bargaining power.

### **Opportunity Sizing**

* Sierra Leone has thousands of commercial bikers, with Freetown being a major hub.  
* Government and local authorities lack a structured database for biker-related payments and incidents.  
* A DAO framework could create a first-of-its-kind governance model for informal transport workers.

## **3\. Solution Design**

### **Design Principles**

* **Accessibility First** – Ensure mobile money and low-data options (USSD).  
* **Transparency** – Blockchain records transactions and claims immutably.  
* **Fair & Decentralized** – DAO voting ensures biker representation.
