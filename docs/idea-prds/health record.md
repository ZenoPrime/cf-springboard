# **PRD: Interoperable Health Record System**

## **Overview**

Design a platform that enables health institutions to share and access patient records digitally in Sierra Leone. The solution should focus on creating APIs and interfaces that allow different hospital systems to exchange information securely.

## **Problem Statement**

Hospitals in Sierra Leone do not have interoperable systems. Patient data must be transferred manually, often on paper, leading to inefficiencies, medical errors, and poor patient outcomes.

## **Goals**

* Digitize patient records.

* Allow authorized hospitals to share/access data.

* Standardize health information formats.

* Improve continuity of care and reduce redundancy.

## **Features**

### **Core Functionalities**

* Patient registration with basic demographics.

* Electronic Medical Records (EMR) view and update.

* Role-based access for doctors, nurses, lab techs.

* Secure record-sharing APIs between facilities.

### **AI Features**

* Predictive analysis for readmission risks.

* Suggest treatment plans based on history.

* OCR to digitize handwritten paper records.

## **Non-Goals**

* Medical billing systems.

* Full-fledged telemedicine platform.

## **User Stories**

1. As a doctor, I want to view a patientâ€™s past visits from other hospitals.

2. As an admin, I want to register and manage patient profiles.

3. As a system, I want to tag patients with critical or things to look out for.

## **Tech Stack Options**

| Option | Framework | Backend | Database | Auth | Hosting |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A | Next.js | Node.js API/Firebase Functions | Supabase/PostgreSQL | Firebase Auth | Vercel |
| B | SvelteKit | \+server.ts or Express.js | Supabase | Supabase Auth | Netlify |

### **Shared Tools**

* AI: OpenAI, TensorFlow (optional ML models)

* OCR: Tesseract.js for scanned medical notes

* Styling: TailwindCSS

* Data Formats: HL7/FHIR structure (basic implementation)

## **Deliverables**

* Role-based access UI.

* At least two hospital mock accounts.

* Patient record interface (must include ways for the patient to share their record).

* Basic EMR sharing via API or simulated integration.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* Completeness of the record management system.

* Implementation of sharing logic.

* Innovation in AI usage.

* Security & privacy handling.

## **Timeline**

* **Day 1**: Research on EMR structure, roles.

* **Day 2-3**: Core development.

* **Day 4**: Security validation and demo.

## **Notes**

* Teams should ensure compliance with basic data security practices (encryption, access control).

* AI and OCR are optional bonus features but improve scoring significantly.
