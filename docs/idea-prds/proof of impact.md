## **Proof of Impact (PoI) Protocol – "DoGood"**

### A decentralized platform that verifies, rewards, and tracks real-world social impact activities using blockchain incentives.

###  **The Problem:**

Across the globe—especially in developing countries—**NGOs, youth groups, and local heroes** are:

* Cleaning communities 

* Running free health camps 

* Educating kids 

* Planting trees  
   But they struggle to **prove their impact** in a way that’s **credible**, **verifiable**, and **rewarded**.

### **The Solution: DoGood Protocol**

A **Proof of Impact system** where users or orgs can

1. **Submit proof** of verified social good (via geo-stamped photos, testimonies, QR-tagged trees, etc.)

2. **Get verified by a network of validators** (volunteers, NGOs, community leaders)

3. **Mint an "Impact NFT"** that reflects the value of their work (with metadata like type of impact, region, timestamp)

4. Earn **reputation points \+ optional token rewards** (powered by SPL tokens or Solana Pay donations)

### **Why This Has Global Impact:**

* NGOs can use **on-chain impact records** for fundraising \+ transparency

* Youth organizations can build **on-chain social CVs**

* Donors and brands can directly support verified impact efforts

* Governments can measure grassroots engagement

### **Solana Features to Leverage:**

* **Compressed NFTs** → Cheap storage of impact proof

* **Token Extensions** → Control who can transfer or redeem reward tokens

* **Solana Pay** → Instant donations to verified changemakers

* **Mobile-first dApp** → Low data, usable even in low-bandwidth areas

* **DAO Tooling (Realms)** → Local groups govern their own validation system

* **DePIN integration** → Use phones or IoT sensors to log environmental work

###  **MVP Idea for Hackathon (Build in 4 weeks)**

* Build a mobile/web app

* Wallet login

* Basic flow: Submit → Validate → Mint Impact NFT → View global leaderboard

* Focus: One region (Freetown), one cause (e.g., urban cleanup)
