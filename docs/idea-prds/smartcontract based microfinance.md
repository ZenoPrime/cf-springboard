**Smart Contract-Based Microfinance Platform (Sierra Leone)** 

**Executive Summary**

SaloneLink MicroLoan is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on Solana, designed to provide transparent, efficient, and accessible micro-loans to individuals in Sierra Leone, integrating seamlessly with existing mobile money services. The platform aims to address critical challenges in the local microfinance sector, such as lack of transparency, delays due to group repayment dependencies, familiarity bias in loan disbursement, and limited direct mobile money integration by many existing Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). By leveraging smart contracts for loan disbursement, repayment tracking, and default management, SaloneLink MicroLoan seeks to offer a fairer, faster, and more reliable lending experience, fostering financial inclusion and economic empowerment. The ultimate goal is to help borrowers build a verifiable credit history and to ensure SaloneLink MicroLoan itself operates with the highest standards of transparency and ethical lending, potentially aligning with principles for responsible financial services.

**Problem Statement & User Stories**

Borrowers in Sierra Leone, particularly small-scale entrepreneurs and individuals in the informal sector, need a reliable and transparent way to access small amounts of credit without facing prohibitive interest rates, biases, or systemic delays caused by traditional lending models. They require a system that integrates with their existing mobile money usage for ease of disbursement and repayment, and one that rewards good individual repayment behavior. SaloneLink MicroLoan provides these functionalities, fostering individual accountability and leveraging blockchain for efficiency and transparency.

* **Accessibility:** Design for users with varying digital literacy and on low-bandwidth networks.  
* **Transparency:** Clear display of loan terms, fees, and repayment schedules.  
* **Visual indicators of progress and status** where applicable (e.g., in web app).  
* **Security & Reliability:** Ensuring user data is safe and platform is dependable.

**Technical Stack**

The platform will be built using a technology stack chosen for Solana integration, security, and scalability for the Sierra Leonean context:

* **Blockchain:**  
  * Solana for fast, low-cost transactions.  
  * Smart Contracts written in Rust using the Anchor framework.  
* **Backend:**
