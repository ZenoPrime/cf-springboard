# **Digital Identity & Credit Scoring System \- Product Requirements Document**

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the product requirements for a blockchain-based platform designed to establish a secure, private, and efficient digital identity and credit scoring system. Leveraging the Solana blockchain, this platform aims to empower individuals with self-sovereign control over their personal data and financial reputation, while providing financial institutions with robust, fraud-resistant tools for identity verification and credit risk assessment. By addressing issues such as identity fraud, limited access to financial services, and data privacy concerns, the system seeks to foster greater financial inclusion and efficiency globally.

## **Problem Statement & User Stories**

The existing paradigms for identity management and credit assessment are plagued by several critical issues:

* **Identity Fraud & Inefficiency:** Traditional identity verification processes are often manual, costly, susceptible to fraud, and create friction in onboarding and transaction workflows for financial institutions and other service providers.  
* **Limited Access to Financial Services:** A significant portion of the global population, particularly those without traditional credit histories or access to established financial systems, faces substantial barriers to obtaining essential financial services like loans and credit.  
* **Data Privacy Concerns:** Centralized repositories of personal identity and financial data are attractive targets for cyberattacks and raise significant privacy concerns for individuals, who often lack control over how their data is used and shared.  
* **Non-Portable Credit History:** Credit scores and histories are typically siloed within specific financial institutions or national borders, making it challenging for individuals to leverage their financial reputation when seeking services from new providers or across different regions.

**User Stories**

* **As an Individual/Consumer**  
  * I want to securely manage my personal digital identity so that I control who can access my information.  
  * I need a way to prove my creditworthiness to lenders using my transaction history, even if I don't have a traditional credit file.  
  * I want my credit history to be portable so I can easily apply for financial services regardless of my location or previous banking relationships.  
  * I need to selectively share only necessary parts of my identity (e.g., "I am over 18" without revealing my birth date) to protect my privacy.  
* **As a Financial Institution (Bank/Lender)**  
  * I need a reliable and efficient way to verify customer identities to reduce fraud and streamline onboarding.  
  * I want access to more comprehensive and trustworthy credit scoring data, especially for individuals underserved by traditional systems, to make more informed lending decisions.  
  * I need a system that helps me comply with KYC and AML regulations more efficiently.  
* **As a Business (e.g., Rental Agency):**  
  * I want to quickly and securely verify an applicant's identity without handling sensitive personal documents.  
* **As a Regulator/Government Entity:**  
  * I want tools that promote financial inclusion and help monitor compliance in the financial sector.

## **Key Features**

The Digital Identity & Credit Scoring System will encompass the following essential features:

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Management:**  
   * **User-Owned Digital Wallets:** Users will securely store and manage their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) within a Solana-compatible digital wallet.  
   * **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Enable trusted third-party entities (e.g., government agencies, educational institutions, employers) to issue cryptographically signed, tamper-proof claims (VCs) about an individual's identity attributes (e.g., name, date of birth, address, qualifications).  
   * **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Unique, persistent, and user-controlled identifiers registered on the Solana blockchain, ensuring user ownership and control over their digital identity.  
2. **Transaction History-Based Credit Scoring**  
   * **On-Chain Transaction Aggregation (Consent-based):** Facilitate the permissioned aggregation of financial transaction history from various sources, including on-chain crypto transactions and potentially off-chain bank accounts via secure APIs (with explicit user consent).  
   * **Algorithmic Credit Scoring:** Implement a transparent and auditable algorithm, potentially encoded as a Solana smart contract, to process aggregated transaction data and generate a dynamic credit score. This will consider various financial behaviors such as payment consistency, savings, and spending patterns.  
   * **Privacy-Preserving Score Derivation:** The system will focus on deriving credit scores on demand or from verifiable inputs, minimizing the centralized storage of raw, sensitive financial data.  
3. **Integration with Financial Institutions (FIs)**  
   * **API/SDK for Lenders:** Provide comprehensive tools (APIs and SDKs) for financial institutions to securely request, verify, and incorporate user-controlled identity attributes and credit scores into their existing onboarding and lending decisioning workflows.  
   * **Automated Underwriting Support:** Enable FIs to integrate the derived credit score into their automated underwriting systems, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.  
4. **Privacy-Preserving Verification**  
   * **Selective Disclosure:** Users will have granular control over their data, allowing them to selectively disclose only the necessary pieces of information (VCs or specific attributes from VCs) required for a verification process, without revealing extraneous details.  
   * **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** (Future consideration beyond MVP, but a key long-term capability) Implement ZKPs to enable individuals to prove certain facts about their identity or creditworthiness (e.g., "my income is above X" or "I am over 18") without revealing the underlying sensitive data itself.  
5. **Portable Credit History**  
   * By anchoring identity and the basis for credit scoring to user-controlled DIDs and verifiable on-chain transactions, the system inherently provides a globally portable credit history that is not tied to a single institution or jurisdiction.  
6. **Reputation System (Extended)**  
   * While credit scoring is financial, the underlying SSI framework could support a broader, verifiable reputation system based on authenticated interactions and commitments across various domains.

## **MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)**

To validate the core concept and establish the foundational components, the MVP will concentrate on **Basic Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Issuance and Verification**. This will demonstrate the user's control over their identity data and the ability for a third party to verify a specific claim with privacy.

The MVP will include:

1. **Mock Issuer Interface:** A simplified web interface for a **single, predefined "Mock ID Authority"** (e.g., "University Registrar" or "Utility Provider"). This mock issuer will have the ability to cryptographically sign and issue a **single, simple verifiable credential (VC)** to a user. Examples of VCs could be "has a verified email address" or "is a registered user of this platform."  
2. **Basic User (Holder) Wallet:** A rudimentary web-based user interface for a **single mock user** to receive, store, and manage this one specific VC within a simplified Solana-compatible digital wallet. The VC will be represented on the Solana blockchain (e.g., as a custom program account or a simple data record that references the verifiable claim).  
3. **Mock Verifier Interface:** A basic web interface for a **single, predefined "Mock Service Provider"** (e.g., "Online Forum Login"). This verifier will be able to request and verify the specific VC from the user's wallet.  
4. **Selective Disclosure Simulation:** The user's wallet will demonstrate the ability to present only the requested VC to the verifier, which will then query the Solana blockchain to confirm the authenticity and validity of the VC.  
5. **Core Solana Smart Contract:** A Solana program (smart contract) capable of:  
   * Registering DIDs (simplified for MVP).  
   * Allowing the "Mock Issuer" to issue VCs that are anchored or referenced on-chain.  
   * Enabling the "Mock Verifier" to check the cryptographic validity of a presented VC against the on-chain record.

**Out of Scope for MVP:**

* Comprehensive transaction history aggregation for credit scoring.  
* Any credit scoring algorithm or score generation.  
* Integration with real-world financial institutions or bank APIs.  
* Complex identity attributes or multiple types of VCs.  
* Advanced privacy-preserving technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs.  
* Detailed user profiles, social features, or full-scale wallet functionalities.  
* Regulatory compliance mechanisms beyond a basic conceptual understanding.

This focused MVP will serve to validate the fundamental principles of self-sovereign identity on Solana, demonstrating user control, privacy, and verifiable claims, which are the essential building blocks for the more complex credit scoring aspects.
