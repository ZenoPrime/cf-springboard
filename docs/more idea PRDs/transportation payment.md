# **Transportation Payment & Tracking System \- Product Requirements Document**

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the product requirements for a blockchain-based platform designed to enhance public transportation payments, logistics, and operational transparency. Leveraging the Solana blockchain, this system aims to streamline payment processes, improve fleet management, enable fair and automated revenue sharing among transport operators, and provide valuable data for route optimization. By addressing challenges such as cash handling, inefficient ticketing, and opaque revenue distribution, the platform seeks to create a more efficient, user-friendly, and trustworthy public transportation ecosystem.

## **Problem Statement & User Stories**

The current public transportation landscape often faces significant inefficiencies and challenges:

* **Cash Handling & Fraud:** Traditional ticket sales often involve extensive cash handling, leading to security risks, reconciliation errors, and potential for fraud for both operators and passengers.  
* **Inefficient Ticketing Systems:** Legacy ticketing methods (paper tickets, magnetic cards) can be cumbersome for passengers, costly to print and distribute, and lack real-time data on usage.  
* **Opaque Revenue Sharing:** In multi-operator public transport systems, the distribution of revenue based on actual usage can be complex, manual, and prone to disputes due to a lack of transparent and verifiable data.  
* **Lack of Real-time Operational Insights:** Transport authorities and operators often lack immediate, accurate data on passenger flow and vehicle movement, hindering effective fleet management and route optimization.  
* **Limited Pricing Flexibility:** Existing systems struggle to implement dynamic, usage-based, or personalized pricing models that could enhance efficiency and fairness.

**User Stories:**

* **As a Commuter/Passenger:**  
  * I want a fast and easy way to pay for my public transport rides using my phone or a digital card.  
  * I need my fares to be calculated accurately based on my actual travel (e.g., distance, zones).  
  * I want a digital record of my journeys and payments for personal tracking.  
* **As a Public Transportation Operator:**  
  * I need to reduce the operational costs and risks associated with cash handling and ticket printing.  
  * I want an automated and transparent way to receive my share of revenue based on the actual usage of my vehicles.  
  * I need real-time data on my fleet's location and passenger loads to optimize operations.  
* **As a City/Regional Transportation Authority:**  
  * I want to oversee the efficiency of the entire public transport network with transparent data.  
  * I need insights into passenger movement patterns to optimize routes and public transport planning.  
  * I want to implement flexible pricing strategies based on demand or specific zones.  
* **As a Vehicle Maintenance Team:**  
  * I need to easily access digital logs of vehicle performance and maintenance history.

## **Key Features**

The Transportation Payment & Tracking System will encompass the following essential features:

1. **Digital Ticketing System:**  
   * **Tokenized Tickets:** Issue single-ride, multi-ride, or subscription tickets as unique, verifiable digital assets (e.g., NFTs or custom tokens) on the Solana blockchain, stored in user wallets.  
   * **Seamless Validation:** Enable rapid ticket validation through contactless tap-to-pay (using NFC/QR codes) or scanning at entry/exit points, interacting with the user's digital wallet.  
   * **Usage-Based Pricing:** Smart contracts to automatically calculate fares based on configurable parameters like distance traveled, zones crossed, time of day, or specific transport modes.  
   * **Subscription/Pass Management:** Digital passes (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) managed as Verifiable Credentials (VCs) or specific tokens, allowing for easy renewal and verification.  
2. **Fleet Management Integration:**  
   * **Real-time Vehicle Tracking:** Integration with IoT devices on public transport vehicles to securely broadcast real-time location, speed, and potentially occupancy data to a verifiable off-chain data layer or directly to the blockchain.  
   * **Route Adherence Monitoring:** Smart contracts to verify if vehicles are following designated routes and schedules, triggering alerts for deviations.  
   * **Maintenance & Performance Logging:** On-chain or verifiable off-chain recording of critical vehicle maintenance records, mileage, and performance metrics for auditability.  
3. **Automated Revenue Sharing:**  
   * **Smart Contract-based Distribution:** Revenue generated from digital ticket sales is automatically collected into a smart contract and then transparently distributed to participating transport operators based on predefined, immutable rules (e.g., percentage of fare, distance covered by their fleet, number of passengers).  
   * **Transparent Accounting:** All revenue flows and distributions are recorded on the Solana blockchain, providing an auditable ledger for all stakeholders.  
4. **Route Optimization:**  
   * **Aggregated Ridership Data:** Collection and aggregation of anonymized data on passenger flow and usage patterns across the network.  
   * **Data Analytics Dashboard:** Provide city authorities and operators with dashboards showcasing insights derived from real-time and historical data for route planning, service adjustments, and resource allocation.  
5. **Integration with Existing Transport Networks:**  
   * **APIs & SDKs:** Offer developer tools for seamless integration with existing fare collection systems, GPS trackers, operational dashboards, and passenger information displays.  
   * **Hardware Compatibility Guidelines:** Provide specifications for adapting or integrating with existing turnstiles, validators, and vehicle tracking units.

## **MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)**

For the initial Proof of Concept (PoC) and subsequent Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will focus on **Basic Digital Ticketing and Single-Operator Payment Collection**.

The MVP will include:

1. **Mock Operator Ticket Sales Interface:** A simple web interface for a **single, mock public transport operator** (e.g., "City Bus Transit") to "sell" a basic digital ticket (e.g., a single-ride ticket for a specific route) to a mock passenger's Solana wallet. The ticket would be represented as a **simple Solana NFT or a custom fungible token** with metadata defining its validity.  
2. **Basic Passenger Wallet & Purchase Flow:** A rudimentary web-based user interface for a **single mock passenger** to connect their Solana-compatible digital wallet, "purchase" the mock ticket, and have it appear in their wallet.  
3. **Simulated Validator:** A basic web page or script that simulates a "ticket scanner" at a bus entrance. When the mock passenger "taps" or "scans" their digital ticket (by interacting with this validator UI and confirming a transaction), the validator would query the Solana blockchain to confirm the ticket's existence and validity (e.g., that it hasn't been used yet, belongs to the passenger's wallet, and matches the route/type).  
4. **Core Solana Smart Contract for Ticketing:** A Solana program capable of:  
   * Minting new digital tickets (NFTs or tokens).  
   * Allowing the "Mock Operator" to initiate sales.  
   * Implementing a simple "mark as used" or "burn" function on the ticket upon successful validation to prevent reuse.

**Out of Scope for MVP:**

* Fleet management integration (real-time tracking, maintenance logs).  
* Automated revenue sharing among multiple operators.  
* Complex route optimization algorithms or dynamic pricing.  
* Integration with physical ticketing hardware (turnstiles, actual NFC readers).  
* Full-fledged passenger journey tracking or personalized travel info.  
* Complex subscription or pass management features.  
* Any form of cash handling or traditional payment gateway integration beyond crypto.
